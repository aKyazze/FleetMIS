✅ ================== 5. Optional Features to Add Later =============================

✅ Mileage Calculations. 

✅ Totals in services offered. 

✅  Email/SMS Notifications to fleet Manager, Driver, and Requestor
 i.e:
 * Driver is notified when a car is allocated, when a request for trip is assigned etc, 
 * Manager is notified when a car is returned, when there is a pending request for approval etc, 
 * Requestor is notified when a car is allocated for trip etc
 and other required or necessary notifications to respective individuals in the system. 

✅  Export reports all trip logs with alert summaries and all other required info in (CSV, PDF) for Printing reports. 


Chart views (speed trends, fuel drop, etc.)


Final Project report. 

🛡️ Bonus Suggestions for Professionalism
🔐 You can restrict viewing alerts to FleetManagers using Django groups.

📩 Use email notification via Django’s send_mail() in the signal if needed.

📊 Add a dashboard widget to count/display unread alerts.

Would you like me to help:

Add email alerts in this signal?

Create a notification bell icon for alerts on the navbar?

Build CSV download or filtering for alerts?




Add the following views and URLs (if not already):

assigned_trips

driver_profile

trip_history

Would you like a cleaned-up or refactored version of any of these views for better readability or maintainability?


 Step 2: Define Navigation and Main Activities
We'll use:

Navigation Drawer (like your sidebar)

Bottom Navigation (optional for mobile ergonomics)

🔹 Step 3: Create Core UI Layouts (to match your Django app)
We'll now mirror the major views you have in Django.

Here are the essential screens to replicate:

Login

Dashboard

List Views (e.g., vehicles, users, etc.)

Form Screens (Add Vehicle, Add Driver, etc.)


🔹 Step 4: Connect to Django via API
Assuming your Django app already uses django-rest-framework, here’s how the Android app will interact:

Tools:
Retrofit: For API calls

Gson/Moshi: For JSON parsing

ViewModel + LiveData: For state management

🔹 Step 5: Use ViewPager / RecyclerView for Lists
To match your list views (table in HTML), we’ll use RecyclerView in Android.

🔹 Step 6: Apply Theming Globally
In themes.xml, modify to use your primary colors:
🔹 Step 7: Implement Dashboard
Each card (like in your Django dashboard) will be a CardView component.
